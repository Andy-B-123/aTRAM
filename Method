FIRST STEP BLAST: NEED TO HAVE BLAST LOADED


1. runtblastn.pl -- run tblastn of reference peptides against blast database
2. getsequencetoretrieve.pl -- makes gene files with top hits from blast
3. runretrieveseq.pl -- uses blastdbcmd to pull sequences from blast db

## IF illumina run was paired end run getpairedend.pl script to pull the other read####

ASSEMBLE SHORT READS PER GENE - NEED TO HAVE AMOS LOADED

5.  runminimus.pl  -- 

### Possibly add in an iterative step here where we go back with the assemblies and blast them against the illumina database again###
### Kevin suggested running it 5 times, I am doing some tests here to see how this affects our %coverage#########

BLAST SHORT READS AGAINST THE REFERENCE DNA

6. 6-runblast.pl
7. 7-getexons.pl  -- will read through the blast output and pull only the sequence that matched (exons) reverse transcribe if necessary.

ALIGN SHORT READS TO REFERENCE GENE USING MUSCLE

8. 8-makealignmentfiles.pl -- need reference DNA reads
9. 9-runmuscle.pl -- need muscle program -- strong gap opening penalty

CREATE CONSENSUS FILES PER GENE

10. makefastafrommuscle.pl
11. makeconsensussequence.pl
