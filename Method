FIRST STEP BLAST: NEED TO HAVE BLAST LOADED

1. create blast database with illumina reads
2. runtblastn.pl -- run tblastn of reference peptides against blast database
3. getsequencetoretrieve.pl -- makes gene files with top hits from blast
4. runretrieveseq.pl -- uses blastdbcmd to pull sequences from blast db

ASSEMBLE SHORT READS PER GENE - NEED TO HAVE AMOS LOADED

5.  runminimus.pl  -- 

BLAST SHORT READS AGAINST THE REFERENCE DNA
