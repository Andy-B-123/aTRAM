FIRST STEP BLAST: NEED TO HAVE BLAST LOADED

1. create blast database with illumina reads
2. runtblastn.pl -- run tblastn of reference peptides against blast database
3. getsequencetoretrieve.pl -- makes gene files with top hits from blast
4. runretrieveseq.pl -- uses blastdbcmd to pull sequences from blast db

ASSEMBLE SHORT READS PER GENE - NEED TO HAVE AMOS LOADED

5.  runminimus.pl  -- 

BLAST SHORT READS AGAINST THE REFERENCE DNA

6. 6-runblast.pl
7. 7-getexons.pl  -- will read through the blast output and pull only the sequence that matched (exons) reverse transcribe if necessary.

ALIGN SHORT READS TO REFERENCE GENE USING MUSCLE

8. 8-makealignmentfiles.pl -- need reference DNA reads
9. 9-runmuscle.pl -- need muscle program -- strong gap opening penalty
