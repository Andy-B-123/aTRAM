FIRST STEP BLAST: NEED TO HAVE BLAST LOADED


1. runtblastn.pl -- run tblastn of reference peptides against blast database
2. sequenceretrieval.pl -- makes name files with top hits from blast and uses blastdbcmd to pull the sequences
### step 2 need to get rid of duplicate sequences#########

## If illumina run was paired end run getpairedend.pl script to pull the other read####
3. getboth.pl  -- redo this script possibly with some pre-processing and a different way to go through the illumina file. #awesomediscussionwihtdaisie


ASSEMBLE SHORT READS PER GENE - NEED TO HAVE AMOS LOADED

5.  runminimus.pl  -- 


### Possibly add in an iterative step here where we go back with the assemblies and blast them against the illumina database again###
### Kevin suggested running it 5 times, I am doing some tests here to see how this affects our %coverage#########

BLAST SHORT READS AGAINST THE REFERENCE GENE - for all 10,774 genes

REMOVE ALL OF BELOW AND REPLACE IT WIHT DIAISIE'S PULL EXONS SCRIPT.
WORK OUT HOW TO GET THE INTRONS.



OLD: 
6. runblast.pl
7. getexons.pl  -- will read through the blast output and pull only the sequence that matched (exons) reverse transcribe if necessary.

ALIGN SHORT READS TO REFERENCE GENE USING MUSCLE

8. makealignmentfiles.pl -- need reference DNA reads
9. runmuscle.pl -- need muscle program -- strong gap opening penalty

CREATE CONSENSUS FILES PER GENE

10. makefastafrommuscle.pl
11. makeconsensussequence.pl
